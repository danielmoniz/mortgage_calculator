This is a simple script to compare two strategies for mortgage payments:
* 30 year plan
   * lower monthly payments
   * more total paid toward mortgage
   * Strategy: invest money that is not being spent on higher payments for entire 30 years
* 20 year plan
   * higher monthly payments
   * less total paid toward mortgage
   * Strategy: invest money that is not being spent on mortgage for last 10 years

### Results:

The conclusion is that spending less monthly on a mortgage means losing less money overall due to 30 year investments being significantly more lucrative.

Total spend:
   * 30 years: $455760
   * 20 years: $399600

Additional spent with 30 year mortgage: -56160

Total spend after mortgage and investments:
   * 30 years: $-121745.34
   * 20 years: $-198962.49
