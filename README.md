This is a simple script to compare two strategies for mortgage payments:
* 30 year plan
   * lower monthly payments
   * more total paid toward mortgage
   * Strategy: invest money that is not being spent on higher payments for entire 30 years
* 20 year plan
   * higher monthly payments
   * less total paid toward mortgage
   * Strategy: invest money that is not being spent on mortgage for last 10 years

The conclusion is that spending less monthly on a mortgage means losing less money overall due to 30 year investments being significantly more lucrative.
